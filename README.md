# lifxlan

**lifxlan** is a Python module for locally controlling LIFX devices (such as lightbulbs) over a LAN. It implements the [LIFX LAN Protocol V2](https://github.com/LIFX/lifx-protocol-docs) specification.

## How to Install

To get the latest stable release:

`sudo pip install lifxlan`

However, to be guaranteed to get the most recent features and fixes you can install from source with:

`sudo python setup.py install`

## Run

See the `examples` folder for example scripts that use **lifxlan**.  

Many of the examples perform device discovery in the beginning in order to find indvidual bulbs, which causes a short but noticeable delay. However, see `broadcast_on.py`, `broadcast_off.py`, and `broadcast_color.py` for ways to send commands to all lights quickly from the command line without doing device discovery.

## Overview

You can do several things with this library:

* Control LIFX devices using the package's high-level API (see the `examples` folder and the following API sections).
* Build your own high-level API on top of the low-level networking messages.
* Build virtual LIFX devices in software (think adapters for Philips Hue bulbs, Wemo, etc).

<!---
That's right, you can also use the low-level networking library to create messages that LIFX *devices* send to *clients*, effectively simulating a LIFX device in software. That means you can write a software program that looks and acts like a LIFX device, but is really converting SetColor and/or SetPower messages into API calls for other RGB lightbulbs or on/off devices, like Philips Hue bulbs and Wemos.

TL;DR: Theoretically, you can use this library to write proxy programs that let you view and control your Hue lights and Wemos through the LIFX app! Whoa!

#### High-Level API:

* **lifxlan.py** - Provides the LifxLAN API, and low-level API for sending broadcast LIFX packets to the LAN.
* **device.py** - Provides the Device API, and low-level API for sending unicast LIFX packets to a Device.
* **light.py** - Provides the Light API. Subclass of Device.

##### LifxLAN API

```
# power can be "on"/"off", True/False, 0/1, or 0/65535
# color is a list of HSBK values: [hue (0-65535), saturation (0-65535), brightness (0-65535), Kelvin (2500-9000)]
# duration is the transition time in milliseconds
# rapid is True/False. If True, don't wait for device response before proceeding, just send multiple packets and move on
# arguments in [square brackets] are optional

get_lights()                                            # returns list of Light objects
set_power_all_lights(power, [duration], [rapid])        # set power for all lights on LAN
set_color_all_lights_color(color, [duration], [rapid])  # set color for all lights on LAN
get_power_all_lights()                                  # returns dict of Light, power pairs
get_color_all_lights()                                  # returns dict of Light, color pairs

```

Note: These have only been tested on one bulb so far. If you test the above calls on a setup with multiple bulbs, let me know how it goes!

##### Light API

The Light API provides everything in the Device API, as well as:

```
# power can be "on"/"off", True/False, 0/1, or 0/65535
# color is a HSBK list of values: [hue (0-65535), saturation (0-65535), brightness (0-65535), Kelvin (2500-9000)]
# duration is the transition time in milliseconds
# rapid is True/False. If True, don't wait for device response before proceeding, just send multiple packets and move on
# arguments in [square brackets] are optional

set_power(power, [duration], [rapid])   
set_color(color, [duration], [rapid])                                   
get_power()                             # returns 0 or 65535
get_color()                             # returns color (HSBK list)
```

The Light API also provides macros for basic colors, like RED, BLUE, GREEN, etc. Setting colors is as easy as `mybulb.set_color(BLUE)`. See light.py for complete list of color macros.

#### LIFX LAN Protocol Implementation:

The LIFX LAN protocol V2 specification is officially documented [here](https://github.com/LIFX/lifx-protocol-docs). In lifxlan, you can see the underlying stream of packets being sent and received at any time by initializing the LifxLAN object with the verbose flag set: `lifx = LifxLAN(verbose = True)`. (Ssee `examples/verbose_lan.py`.)

The files that deal with LIFX packet construction and representation are:

* **message.py** -  Defines the message fields and the basic packet structure.
* **msgtypes.py** - Provides subclasses for each LIFX message type, along with their payload constructors.
* **unpack.py** - Creates a LIFX message object from a string of binary data (crucial for receiving messages).
