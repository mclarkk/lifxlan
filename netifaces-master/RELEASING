Release Instructions
====================

First, update the CHANGELOG as well as README.rst and setup.py.

Next, commit any changes for the release, then tag the release with

  git tag release_a_b_c

where the version number is a.b.c.  Make sure you push with the --tags
option to get the tag back onto Github.

Now wait for Travis and Appveyor to complete their builds; Appveyor in
particular builds the Windows wheels, so you can't complete a release
until it has finished.

Finally, when the release is complete, run

  ./build-manylinux1
  ./build-osx
  ./fetch-win32-wheels a.b.c release_a_b_c
  python setup.py sdist

and then upload using

  twine upload dist/netifaces-a.b.c.tar.gz wheelhouse/netifaces-a.b.c-*.whl
