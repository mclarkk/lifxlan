2019-01-02	Version 0.10.8

	* Fixed a bug that in certain circumstances could lead to an infinite
	loop in netifaces.gateways() (thanks asomers).
	* Fixed a memory management bug in an error path (thanks NicoPy).

2018-05-08	Version 0.10.7

	* Added LICENSE file
	* Automated Windows builds via AppVeyor.

2017-06-01	Version 0.10.6

	* Fixed netmask determination on Windows.
	* All addresses are now unicode strings on all platforms,
	regardless of Python version.

2016-08-23	Version 0.10.5

	* Fixed setup.py in case there's no print (thanks Stavros).
	* Fixed a potential one-byte stack overwrite (thanks Doug Horn).
	* Fixed possible null pointer deference (thanks bastiak).
	* Added support for IPv6 address flags on BSD/Mac OS X (thanks
	stefann).
	* Respect interface priorities when determining default gateway
	(on Windows and Linux).
	* Use CIDR notation for IPv6 netmasks.
	* Ignore broadcast addresses in the 169.254.0.0/16 range (it
	appears Cygwin's getaddrinfo() may erroneously generate these).
	* Stop using deprecated WSAAddressToStringA() API on Windows
	in favour of using WSAAddressToStringW() where available.  Falls
	back to the older API if required.

2014-05-19	Version 0.10.4

	* Fixed a problem with multi-part Netlink messages on Linux.

2014-05-06	Version 0.10.3

	* When using Netlink (i.e. Linux), check for the constant
	NLM_F_DUMP_INTR, since it only appeared in kernel version 3.1

2014-05-03	Version 0.10.2

	* Added a workaround for broken netlink headers on certain Linux
	distributions (the problem being that the netlink headers fail to
	include <bits/sockaddr.h>, which causes a build failure).

2014-05-02	Version 0.10.1

	* Fixed a problem with the gateways() function that caused it a
	crash on PyPy.
	* The CI system is now set up to build for PyPy as well, so
	problems will be found sooner.

2014-05-01	Version 0.10.0

	* Python 3 compatibility.
	* Improved Windows source code compatibility.
	* Added gateway detection via gateways() function.
	* New version number format (skipped 0.9.0 due to its use by
	the netifaces-merged fork).

2012-01-31 	Version 0.8

	All changes in this version relate to the ioctl( ) code path,
	which is not used on Windows or on any modern UNIX or UNIX-like
	system that implements getaddrinfo().

	* Fixed bit-rot in the ioctl() code path.
	* Fixed a problem with setup.py that might manifest itself if the
	config.cache file was manually edited.
	* Fixed the ioctl() code path to cope with systems that have
	sa_len and return longer than normal struct ifreq requests from
	SIOCG[L]IFCONF (for instance, Mac OS X).

2012-01-30	Version 0.7

	* Dropped support for Win2K and earlier
	* Added support for addresses other than IPv4 on Windows
	* Removed empty 'addr' entries for interfaces that don't provide
	any addresses.
	* Fixed problems with setup script that prevented it running on
	Windows, and improved the chances of it working with
	cross-compilers somewhat.
	* Added a verion property to the module that you can test at
	runtime.

2011-11-04	Version 0.6

	* Added a workaround for a FreeBSD kernel bug (kern/152036).
	* Added address_families dictionary to allow code to look up the
	symbolic name corresponding to a given numberic address family
	code.
